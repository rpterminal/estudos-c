# Basics
-  The basic operations of a computer will form what is known as the computer's instruction set.
-  To solve a problem using a computer, you must provide a solution by sending instructions to the instruction set. Thus, a computer program sends the instructions necessary to solve a specific problem.
-  The approach or method that is used to solve the problem is known as an algorithm.
-  To write a program, you need to write the instructions necessary to implement the algorithm. These instructions would be expressed in the statements of a particular computer language.
# Terminology
-  CPU - Central processing unit. Where the instructions are executed, and the computing is done. The brain of the computer.
-  RAM - Random access memory. Stores the data of a program while it is running.
-  Hard drive - The permanent storage of the computer, storing files that contain program source code.
-  Operating system - A program that controls the entire operation of a computer: manages all input and output, manages the computers resources and handles the execution of programs. The kernel is the brain of the operating system.
-  Fetch/execute cycle - Fetches an instruction from memory, using registers, and executes it in a loop.

# Higher level programming languages
-  Programming languages that make it easier to write programs.
-  Opposite of assembly language.
-  C is a higher level programming language that describes in a more abstract form.
-  The instructions (statements) of a program look more like problem solving steps.
-  Minimizes the worry about the precise steps a particular CPU would have to take to accomplish a particular task.
-  Compilers - programs that translate the high-level language source code into the detailed set of machine language instructions that the computer requires. Compilers will also check that your program has valid syntax, finding erros and reporting them.
-  Much easier to learn and much easier to program than program languages.
# Writing a program
1.  Define the program objetives
 -  Understand the requirements of the program.
 -  Get a clear idea of what you want the program to accomplish.
2.  Design the program
 -  Decide how the program will meet the above requirements.
 -  What should the user interface be like?
 -  How should the program be organized?
3.  Write the code
 -  Start implementation, translate the design in the syntax of the language.
 -  Usage of a text editor to create what is called a source code file.
4.  Compile
 -  Translate the source code into executable code.
 -  Consists of detailed instructions to the CPU expressed in a numeric code.
5.  Run the program
 -  The executable file is a program you can run.
6.  Test and debug the program
 -  Just because a program is running, it doesn't mean that it works as intended.
 -  Testing assures that your program does what it is supposed to do.
 -  Debugging is the process of finding and fixing program errors (bugs).
7.  Maintain and modify the program
 -  Programs are released, used, maintained and modified by many people.
 -  Developers have to continue to fix new bugs or add new features.
 For the above steps, a developer may have to jump around and repeat steps. The larger and more complex the program is, the more planning it requires, and the more rigorously the step-by-step structure should be followed. The habit of planning before coding is an essential practice. When coding, you always want to work in small steps and constantly test.
