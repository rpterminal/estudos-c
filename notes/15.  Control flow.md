# Overview
- The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear
- Control flow statements, however, will break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code
	- Decision-making statements: if-then, if-then-else, switch, goto
	- Looping statements: for, while, do-while
	- Branching statements: break, continue, return
# Decision making
- Structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program
	- If a condition is true, then a statement or statements is/are executed
	- If a condition is false, then other statements are executed

## If statements
- The C programming language provides a general decision-making capability in the form of an if statement
```
if (expression)
	program statement
```
- Translating a statement such as “if it’s not raining, then I will go swimming” into the C language is practical
```
if (it is not raining)
	I will go swimming
```
- The if statement is used to stipulate the execution of a program statement(s) based upon specified conditions
- The curly brackets are required for compound statements inside the if block
- Example in C:
```C
int score = 95;
int big 90;

// simple statement if, no brackets
if (score > big)
	printf("Jackpot!\n");

// compound statement if, brackets
if (score > big) {
	score++;
	printf("You win!\n");
}
```
- List of if statements:

| statement | description                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| if        | an if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements                                |
| if...else | an if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executed when the boolean expression is false |
| nested if | you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s)                                  |
### If else
- You can extend the if statement with a small addition that gives you a lot more flexibility
```
if (expression)
	statement 1;
else
	statement2;
```
- For example:
  If the rain today is worse than the rain yesterday,
  I will take my umbrella
  Else,
  I will take my jacket
  Then I will go to work.
- This is exactly the kind of decision making the if-else statement provides
- Example in C:
  ```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
int number_to_test, remainder;

printf("Enter your number to be tested: ");
scanf("%i", &number_to_test);

remainder = number_to_test % 2;

if (remainder == 0) {
	printf("The number is even.\n");
}
else {
	printf("The number is odd.\n");
}

return 0;
}
```
### Else if
- You can handle additional complex decision making by adding an if statement to your else clause 
```
if (expression 1)
	program statement 1
else
	if (expression 2)
		program statement 2
	else
		program statement 3
```
or
```
if (expression 1)
	program statement 1
else if (expression 2)
	program statement 2
else
	program statement 3
```
- The above extends the if statement from a two-valued logic decision to a three-valued logic decision formatted using the else if construct
- Example in C:
```C
// program to implement the sign function
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
int number, sign;

printf ("Please type a number: ");
scanf("%i", &number);

if (number < 0) {
	sign = -1;
}
else if (number == 0) {
	sign = 0;
}
else {
	sign = 1
}

printf ("Sign = %i\n", sign);

return 0;
}
```
### Nested if-else statement
- A nested if-else statement means you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s)
```
if (boolean_expression 1) {
	// executes when the boolean expression 1 is true
	if (boolean_expression 2) {
		//executes when the boolean expression 2 is true
	}
}
```
- Example in C:
```C
if (gameIsOver == 0) {
	if (playerToMove == YOU)
		printf ("Your move\n");
	else 
		printf ("My move\n");
else
	printf ("The game is over\n");
}
```
## The conditional operator (ternary statement)
- The conditional operator is a unique operator unlike all other operators in C
- Most operators are either unary or binary operators. The conditional operator is defined as ternary, which means is takes three operands
- The two symbols that are used to denote this operator are the question mark (?) and the colon (:)
- The first operand is placed before the ?, the second between the ? and the :, and the third after the : 
	- condition ? expression1 : expression2
- The conditional operator evaluates to one of two expressions, depending on whether a logical expression evaluates true or false
- The operator is arranged in relation to the operands in this way:
	- The ? character follows the logical expression/condition
	- Following the  ? are two operands, expression1 and expression 2, that represent choices
	- The value that results from the operation will be the value of expression1 if the condition evaluates to true, or the value of expression2 if the conditions evaluates to false
- Example:
  x = y > 7 ? 25 : 50;
	- Results in x being set to 25 if y is greater than 7, or to 50 otherwise
	- This is the same as:
	  if (y > 5)
		  x = 25;
	  else
		  x = 50;
- An expression for the maximum or minimum of two variables can be written very simply using the conditional operator
## Switch statement
- When the value of a variable is successively compared against different values, the switch statement is used for convenience and efficiency
- Switch syntax:
```
switch (expression) {
	case value 1:
		program statement
		...
		break;
	case value n:
		program statement
		program statement
		...
		break;
	default:
		program statement
		...
		break;
}
```
- The expression enclosed within parentheses is successfully compared against the values: value 1, value 2, ..., value n
- Cases must be simple constants or constant expressions
- If a case is found whose value is equal to the value of the expression, then the statements that follow the case are executed
- When more than one statement is included, they do not have to be enclosed within braces
- The break statement signals the end of a particular case and causes execution of the switch statement to be terminated
- The special optional case called default is executed if the value of expression does not match any of the case values
- Switch case example:
```C
enum Weekday {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};
enum Weekday today = Monday;

switch(today) {
	case Sunday:
		printf("Today is Sunday.");
		break;
	case Monday:
		printf("Today is Monday.");
		break;
	case Tuesday:
		printf("Today is Tuesday.");
		break;
	default:
		printf("whatever");
		break;
}
```
# Repetition executing
- There may be a situation in which you need to execute a block of code several times
- A loop statement allows the developer to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times
- Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence
	- When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed — break and continue
- A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false — the for loop is traditionally used for this purpose
- The number of times that a loop is repeated can be controlled in two ways:
	- Counter controlled loop: using a count, repeating the statement block a specific given number of times
	- Condition controlled loop: the number of times that a loop  is repeated can depend on when a certain condition is met, like the user entering “quit”
![[Pasted image 20250317170150.png]]
## For loop
- One typically uses the for loop to execute a block of statements a given number of times
- For example: if one wants to display the numbers from 1 to 10, instead of typing ten statements that call `printf()`, one would use a for loop of count 1-10
```C
for(int count = 1; count <= 10; ++count) {
	printf("%d", count);
}
```
- The for loop operation is controlled by what appears between the parentheses that follow the keyword for (a function). Furthermore, the three control expressions that are separated by semicolons control the operation of the loop
- The action that you want to repeat each time the loop is executed is the block of code between braces, called body of the loop. One can omit the braces for single statements
- The structure of the for loop is:
```
for(starting condition; continuation condition; action per iteration) {
	loop statement;
	...
}
```
- Syntax:
	- The starting condition usually sets an initial value to a loop control variable, which is typically a count of some kind that tracks how often the loop has been repeated. It can also declare and initialize several variables of the same type with the declarations separated by commas, which will be local to the scope of the loop
	- The continuation condition is a logical expression evaluating to true of false, which determines whether the loop should continue to be executed. As long as this condition returns true, the loop continues. It typically checks the value of the loop control variable, but one can put any logical or arithmetic expression in this condition. It is tested at the beginning of the loop rather than at the end; this means that the loop statement(s) will not be executed if the condition results false
	- The action per iteration is executed at the end of each loop iteration. It is usually an increment or decrement of one or more loop control variables. One can modify several variables in this field using commas to separate them
	- The statement(s) to be repeated is represented by loop statement
	- Example:
```C
for(int i = 1, j = 2; i <= 5; ++i, j = j + 2) { // the brackets are optional in this case
	printf(" %5d", i * j);
}
```
The output produced by this fragment will be the values 2, 8, 18, 32, and 50 on a single line
- Another example:
```C
unsigned long long sum = 0LL; // stores the sum of the integers
unsigned int count = 0; // the number of integers to be summed

// read the number of integers to be summed
printf("\nenter the number of integers you want to sum: ");
scanf(" %u", &count);

// sum integers from 1 to count
for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= count; ++i)
	sum += i;

// or
for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= count; sum += i++);

printf("\ntotal of the first %u numbers is %llu\n", count, sum);
```
## while loop
- repetition of a set of statements for as long as a specified logical expression evaluates to true
- general syntax:
```C
while (expression) {
	statement 1;
	statement 2;
}
```
- the condition is tested at the start/top of the loop. thus, if the expression results as false, the statements will not be executed, and if it returns as true, the code block will execute
- **counter controlled loop:**
```C
int count = 1;

while (count <= 5) {
	printf("%i\n", count);
	++count;
}
```
- **logic controlled loop:**
```C
int num = 0;
scanf("%d", &num);

while (num != -1) {
	scanf("%d", &num);
}
```
## do-while loop
- on the other hand, the condition is at the bottom, after the body (post-test loop) 
- it is guaranteed to execute at least once
- general syntax:
```C
do {
	statement 1;
	statement 2;
}
while (expression);
```
## nested loops
- say you want to count the number of occupants in each house on a street: going from house to house could be a loop, and for each iteration of this loop, there’d be an inner loop that counts the occupants of the house — that is a nested loop
- example:
```C
for (int i = 1; i <= count; ++i){
	int sum = 1;
	int j = 1;

	printf ("\n1");

	while (j < i){
		sum += +=j;
		printf (" + %d", j);
	}
	printf (" = %d", sum):
}
```
### continue statements
- sometimes a situation arises where you do not want to end a loop, but you want to skip the current iteration — the continue statement in the body of a loop does this
- it can eliminate nesting and additional blocks of code for enhanced readability, specially when the statements are long or deeply nested
- example:
```C
enum Day {sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday};

for (enum Day day = sunday; day <= saturday; ++day){
	if (day == wednesday)
		continue;

	printf ("it's not wednesday\n");
}
```
### break statements
- like the continue statement, it alters the behavior of the loop: it causes the program to immediately exit from the loop it is executing
- if the statement is inside nested loops, it affects only the innermost loop containing it
- example:
```C
while (p > 0){
	printf ("%d\n", p);
	scanf ("%d", &q);

	while (q > 0) {
		printf ("%d\n", p * q);
		if (q > 100)
			break;
		scanf ("%d", &q);
	}
	if (q > 100)
		break;
	scanf ("%d", &p);
}
```
