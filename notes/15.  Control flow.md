# Overview
- The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear
- Control flow statements, however, will break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code
	- Decision-making statements: if-then, if-then-else, switch, goto
	- Looping statements: for, while, do-while
	- Branching statements: break, continue, return
# Decision making
- Structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program
	- If a condition is true, then a statement or statements is/are executed
	- If a condition is false, then other statements are executed

## If statements
- The C programming language provides a general decision-making capability in the form of an if statement
```
if (expression)
	program statement
```
- Translating a statement such as “if it’s not raining, then I will go swimming” into the C language is practical
```
if (it is not raining)
	I will go swimming
```
- The if statement is used to stipulate the execution of a program statement(s) based upon specified conditions
- The curly brackets are required for compound statements inside the if block
- Example in C:
```C
int score = 95;
int big 90;

// simple statement if, no brackets
if (score > big)
	printf("Jackpot!\n");

// compound statement if, brackets
if (score > big) {
	score++;
	printf("You win!\n");
}
```
- List of if statements:

| statement | description                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| if        | an if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements                                |
| if...else | an if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executed when the boolean expression is false |
| nested if | you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s)                                  |
### If with an else
- You can extend the if statement with a small addition that gives you a lot more flexibility
```
if (expression)
	statement 1;
else
	statement2;
```
- For example:
  If the rain today is worse than the rain yesterday,
  I will take my umbrella
  Else,
  I will take my jacket
  Then I will go to work.
- This is exactly the kind of decision making the if-else statement provides
- Example in C:
  ```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
int number_to_test, remainder;

printf("Enter your number to be tested: ");
scanf("%i", &number_to_test);

remainder = number_to_test % 2;

if (remainder == 0) {
	printf("The number is even.\n");
}
else {
	printf("The number is odd.\n");
}

return 0;
}
```
### Else if
- You can handle additional complex decision making by adding an if statement to your else clause 
```
if (expression 1)
	program statement 1
else
	if (expression 2)
		program statement 2
	else
		program statement 3
```
or
```
if (expression 1)
	program statement 1
else if (expression 2)
	program statement 2
else
	program statement 3
```
- The above extends the if statement from a two-valued logic decision to a three-valued logic decision formatted using the else if construct
- Example in C:
```C
// program to implement the sign function
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
int number, sign;

printf ("Please type a number: ");
scanf("%i", &number);

if (number < 0) {
	sign = -1;
}
else if (number == 0) {
	sign = 0;
}
else {
	sign = 1
}

printf ("Sign = %i\n", sign);

return 0;
}
```
### Nested if-else statement
- A nested if-else statement means you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s)
```
if (boolean_expression 1) {
	// executes when the boolean expression 1 is true
	if (boolean_expression 2) {
		//executes when the boolean expression 2 is true
	}
}
```
- Example in C:
```C
if (gameIsOver == 0) {
	if (playerToMove == YOU)
		printf ("Your move\n");
	else 
		printf ("My move\n");
else
	printf ("The game is over\n");
}
```
## The conditional operator (ternary statement)
- The conditional operator is a unique operator unlike all other operators in C
- Most operators are either unary or binary operators. The conditional operator is defined as ternary, which means is takes three operands
- The two symbols that are used to denote this operator are the question mark (?) and the colon (:)
- The first operand is placed before the ?, the second between the ? and the :, and the third after the : 
	- condition ? expression1 : expression2
- The conditional operator evaluates to one of two expressions, depending on whether a logical expression evaluates true or false
- The operator is arranged in relation to the operands in this way:
	- The ? character follows the logical expression/condition
	- Following the  ? are two operands, expression1 and expression 2, that represent choices
	- The value that results from the operation will be the value of expression1 if the condition evaluates to true, or the value of expression2 if the conditions evaluates to false
- Example:
  x = y > 7 ? 25 : 50;
	- Results in x being set to 25 if y is greater than 7, or to 50 otherwise
	- This is the same as:
	  if (y > 5)
		  x = 25;
	  else
		  x = 50;
- An expression for the maximum or minimum of two variables can be written very simply using the conditional operator
# Repetition executing
- There may be a situation in which you need to execute a block of code several times
- A loop statement allows the developer to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times
- Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence
	- When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed — break and continue
- A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false — the for loop is traditionally used for this purpose

## Loop statements

| statement    | description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| while        | repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. tests the condition before executing the loop body |
| for          | executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable                       |
| do...while   | similar to a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body                                   |
| nested loops | one can also nest loop statements inside any another while, for, or do...while loop                                            |
