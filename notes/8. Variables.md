# Overview
- A program needs to store the instructions of its program and the data that it acts upon while the computer is executing that program
	- This information is stored in memory (RAM). RAM’s contents are lost when the computer is turned off
	- Hard drives, on the other hand, store persistent data
- RAM is like an ordered sequence of boxes
	- The box is full when it represents 1, or the box is empty when it represents 0
	- Each box represents one binary digit, either 0 or 1 (true and false)
	- Each box is called a bit
- Bits in memory are grouped into sets of eight, which forms a byte
	- Each byte has been labeled with a number, called the address
	- The address of a byte uniquely references that byte in a computer’s memory
> [!note] 
> Memory consists of a large number of bits that are in groups of eight, called bytes, each with an unique address
# Variables
- The true power of programs you create is their manipulation of data. Thus, we need to understand the data types that can be used, as well as how to create and name variables
- Constants are types of data that do not change and retain their values throughout the life of the program
- On the other hand, variables are types of data that may change or be assigned different values as the program runs
- Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program
- For example, assume you want to store two values, 10 and 20, in your program, and at a later stage, you want to use these two values. You can:
	- Create variables with appropriate names -> store your values in those two variables -> retrieve and use the stored values from the variables
## Naming variables
- The rules for naming variables in C is that all names must begin with a letter or underscore (‘`_`’) and can be followed by any combination of letters, upper- or lowercase, underscores, or digits
- There are certain reserved words that cannot be used to name a variable
- The use of meaningful names when defining variables can dramatically increase the readability of a program, and pay off in the debug and documentation phases
## Declaring variables
- Declaring a variable is when you specify the type of the variable followed by the variable name
- It also specifies to the compiler how a particular variable will be used by the program and how much memory it will allocate to itself
- For example, the keyword `int` is used to declare the basic integer variable
	- First comes `int`, then the chosen name of the variable, and finally a semicolon
		- `type-specifier variable-name;`
- To declare more than one variable, you can declare each variable separately, or you can follow the `int` with a list of names in which each name is separated from the next by a comma
- C requires that all program variables be declared before they are used in a program
- When creating variables, values are not provided for them
	- Values can be assigned to variables using the = operator
	- For example:
```
int x;
x = 112;
```
## Initializing variables
- Initializing a variable means to assign it a starting, or initial, value
- This can be done as part of the declaration by following the variable name with the assignment operator (=) and the value you want the variable to have. For example: `int x = 21;`, `int y = 32, z 14`
- It is best to avoid putting initialized and non-initialized variables in the same declaration statement
