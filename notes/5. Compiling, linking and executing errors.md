# Compiler errors
- Programming languages have rules: syntax and semantics
- A syntax error occurs when something is wrong with the structure of the code
- A semantic error occurs when something is wrong with the meaning of the code
# Compiler warnings
- It means that the compiler has recognized an issue with your code that could lead to a potential problem
- It is only a warning because the compiler is still able to generate correct machine code
# Linker errors
- The linker is having trouble linking all the object files together to create an executable
- Usually, there is a library or object file that is missing
- A common issue is `undefined reference to '(missing reference)'`
# Runtime errors
- Errors that occur when the program is executing
- Some typical runtime errors are: divide by zero, file not found, out of memory, etc.
- This type of error can cause the program to 'crash'
# Logic errors
- Errors or bugs in your code that cause the program to run incorrectly
- Logic errors are mistakes made by the programmer
