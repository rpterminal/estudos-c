# Comments
- Comments are used in a program to document the code, enhancing its readability
- Comments serve to remind you, or someone else reading or maintaining your code, what the program does or what a particular line of code is doing
- Thus, comments are ignored by the compiler and serve no purpose in the compiling of the program
- Comments are useful as to remind, in program, of the purpose of a particular function or line of code
- A simple comment can save a significant amount of time otherwise wasted on having to re-understand or learn the code
- One of the characteristics of high-quality code is the good use of comments
## Syntax
- There are two ways to add comments to a C program:
	- For multi-lined comments, the forward slash ('/') and/or asterisk ('`*`')  marks the beginning of the comment. This type of comment needs to be terminated, by using the same character without any embedded spaces. All characters included between the opening and closing characters are treated as part of the comment
	- For single-line comments, two forward slashes ('/') are used at the start of the line. Any characters that follow these slashes up to the end of the line are considered as a comment
## Use of comments
- It is possible to insert so many comments into a program that the readability is actually degraded instead of improved
- The habit of inserting comment statements into the program as the program of being written or typed in is essential. It makes the program easier to document when the logic is still fresh on the developer's mind, and benefits the debugging when program logic erros are being isolated
- A comment can help you read through the program, but it can also help point the way to the source of the logic mistake
- Meaningful expressions and commentary is essential for self-documenting code
# Preprocessors
- An unique feature of the C language that is not found in many other high-level programming languages
- Allows for programs to be easier to develop, read, modify and port to different computer systems
- It is part of the compilation process that recognizes special statements. It analyzes these statements before the analysis of the program itself.
- It is an instruction to your compiler to do something before compiling the source code.
- Usually, the preprocessors are at the top of C code, but it can be located anywhere
- Preprocessor statements are identified by the presence of a hashtag sign ('#'), which must be the first non-space character on the line
- Some preprocessor statement examples are:
	- `#define` to create your own constants and macros
	- `#include` to build your own library files
	- `#ifdef`, `#endif`, `#else` and `#ifndef` for more power over the program with defined conditions
## The `#include` statement
- It is a preprocessor directive
- It is not strictly part of the executable program. however, the program won't work without it
- The compiler is instructed to "include" in your program the contents of the header file referenced between angled brackets ('<' and '>'). The header file always includes the .h extension
## Header files
- Header files define information about some of the functions that are provided by that file
- stdio.h is the standard C library header and provides functionality for displaying output, among many other things
- stdio.h contains the information that the compiler needs to understand what certain functions with input and output mean
- stdio is short for standard input/output
- Header files specify information that the compiler uses to integrate any predefined functions within a program
- The developer can create their own header files to define function prototypes, constants, etc.
- Header file names are case sensitive in some systems
- There are two ways to `#include` header files in a program: `<[reference].h>` or `"[reference].h`
- Every C compiler that conforms to the C11 standard will have a set of standard header files supplied with it
- The use of `#ifndef` and `#define` to protect against multiple inclusions of a header file is a good habit
- A header file mainly contains function prototypes, but it can include constants, typedef statements,  `#define` directives, structure declarations, etc.
- Typically, a header file is not going to contain implementation code
# Displaying output
- The standard library function `printf()`: 
	- Outputs information to the standard output stream, which is the command line by default. The information displayed is based on what appears between the parentheses that immediately follow the function name
	- One of the most common functions used in C
	- Provides an easy and convenient means to display program results
	- Values of variables, results of computations and strings of characters can be be displayed, which makes it useful for debugging
	- Uses variable names, constants, and expressions as its argument list
# Entering input
- It's useful to ask the user to enter data into a program
- Input can be computed via the terminal
- The C library contains several input functions, and `scanf()` is the most general of them, as it can read a variety of formats
- The function reads the input from the standard input stream "stdin" and scans that input according to the format provided
- The standard input in C is the keyboard
- Format can be a simple constant string, or you can specify %s, %d, %c, %f, etc. to read strings, integer, character or floats respectively
- If the "stdin" is input from the keyboard, then text is read in because typing generate text characters: letters, digits, and punctuation. When you enter the integer 2014, for example, you type the characters "2", "0", "1", and "4". If you want to store that as a numerical value rather than as a string, the program has to convert the string character by character to a numerical value. This is the job of the `scanf()` function
- Like `printf()`, `scanf()` uses a control string followed by a list of arguments. A control string indicates the destination data types for the input stream of characters
- The `scanf()` function uses pointers to variables
- There are three rules for `scanf()`:
	- Returns the number of items that it successfully reads
	- If you use `scanf()` to read a value for one of the basic variable types, precede the variable name with an ampersand ('&')
	- If you use `scanf()` to read a string onto a character array,  the ampersand ('&') is not used
- The `scanf()` function uses whitespace to decide how to divide the input into separate fields
- `scanf()` is the reverse of `printf()`, which converts integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and C strings to text that is to be displayed onscreen. It takes the input and converts it to the same types of data
- When a program uses `scanf()` to gather input from the keyboard, it waits for the user to input some text. Then, when you enter some text and press enter, the program proceeds and reads the input
