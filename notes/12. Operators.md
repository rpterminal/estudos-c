# Overview
- Operators are functions that use a symbolic name
- They perform mathematical or logical functions
- Operators are predefined in C, like in most other programming languages
- Most operators tend to be combined with the infix style — `8 + 5` instead of `+ 8 5` or `8 5 +`
# Basic operators
## Arithmetic operators
- An arithmetic operator is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation
- List of arithmetic operators:

| operator | description                                   | example     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| +        | adds two operands                             | A + B = 30  |
| -        | subtracts second operand from the first       | A - B = -10 |
| *        | multiplies both operands                      | A * B = 200 |
| /        | divides numerator by the denumerator          | B / A = 2   |
| %        | returns  the remainder of an integer division | B % A = 0   |
| ++       | increments the integer value by one           | A++ = 11    |
| --       | decrements the integer value by one           | A-- = 9     |

## Logical operators
- A logical operator, sometimes called a “Boolean” operator, is an operator that returns a Boolean result that is based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions
- List of logical operators:

| operator | description                                                                      | example           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| &&       | AND operator — if both operands are non-zero, the condition becomes true         | ( A&& B) = false  |
| \|\|     | OR operator — if any of the two operands is non-zero, the condition becomes true | (A \|\| B) = true |
| !        | NOT operator — reverses the logical state of its operand                         | !(A && B) = true  |

# Bitwise operators
- C offers bitwise logical operators and shift operators
	- They look something like the logical operators, but operate on the bits in integer values instead
- Not used in the common program
- One major use of the bitwise `AND`, `&`, and `OR` is in operations to test and set individual bits in an integer variable — it can use individual bits to store data that involve one of two choices
- Due to the binary nature of bits, you could, for example, use a single integer variable to store several characteristics of a person
	- Store whether the person is male or female with one bit
	- Use two other bits to specify whether the person can speak English and/or Portuguese
	- Another bit to record whether the person’s salary is $50,000 or more
	- Thus, in just four bits, you have a substantial set of data recorded
- Bitwise operators:

| operator | description                                                                                                                 | example                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `&`      | Binary `AND` operator — copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands                                            | `(A & B) = 12`, i.e. 0000 1100                      |
| `\|`     | Binary `OR` operator — copies a bit if it exists in either operand                                                          | `(A \| B) = 61`, i.e. 0011 1101                     |
| `^`      | Binary `XOR` operator — copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both                                             | `(A ^ B) = 49`, i.e. 0011 0001                      |
| `~`      | Binary “ones complement” operator — is unary and has the effect of ‘flipping’ bits                                          | `(~A) = -61`, i.e. 1100 0011 in 2’s complement form |
| `<<`     | Binary “left shift” operator — the left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified in the right operand   | ` A << 2 = 240`, i.e. 1111 0000                     |
| `>>`     | Binary “right shift” operator — the left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified in the right operand | `A >> 2 - 15`, i.e. 0000 1111                       |
- Truth table:

| p   | q   | p & q | p \| q | p ^ q |
| --- | --- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     | 0      | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 0     | 1      | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 1     | 1      | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 0     | 1      | 1     |
# Cast and `sizeof` operators
## Cast operator
- When developing C programs, one should steer clear of automatic type conversions, especially when it truncates the value. It is a good habit to always perform explicit conversions
- A cast operator enables one to demand the precise type conversion one wants
	- Consists of preceding the quantity with the name of the desired type in parentheses
	- Parentheses and type name together constitute a cast operator, i.e. `(type)`
	- The actual type desired, such as `long`,  is substituted for the word type — `(long)`
- The type cast operator has a higher precedence than all the arithmetic operators, except for the unary minus and unary plus operators
- For example: `(int) 21.51 + (int) 26.99` would equal 47
## `sizeof` operator
- With the `sizeof` operator, one can find out how many bytes are occupied in memory by a given type
- `sizeof` is a special keyword in C
- `sizeof` is an operator, and not a function, because it is evaluated at compile time rather than at runtime, unless a variable-length array is used in its argument
- The argument to the `sizeof` operator can be a variable, an array name, the name of a basic data type, the name of a derived data type, or an expression
- For example: `sizeof(int)` will return the number of bytes occupied by a variable of type `int`
- When applying `sizeof` to an expression, the operator returns the size of the value that results from evaluating the expression
- One uses the `sizeof` operator whenever possible to avoid having to calculate and hard-code sizes into a C program
# Other operators
- The asterisk (‘`*`’), when applied directly to a variable, is an operator that represents a pointer to a variable — for example, `*a;`
- `?:` is an operator used for comparisons — ternary operator
	- If ‘condition’ is true ?  then value X : otherwise value Y 
# Operator precedence
- Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated
- Dictates the order of evaluation when two operators share an operand
- Certain operators have higher precedence than others. For example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator
- The order of executing the various operations can make a difference, so C needs unambiguous rules for choosing what to do first
- Each operator is assigned, thus, a precedence level. For example, multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction, so they are performed first
- Whatever is enclosed in parentheses is executed first — as such, one should always use ‘()’ to group expressions
- When two operators have the same precedence, the associativity rules are applied
- If they share an operand, they are executed according to the order in which they occur in the statement. For most operators, the order is from left to right
- Table of precedence, from highest to lowest:
