- serves to store a multitude of variables in “a single one”
- arrays allow you to group values together under a single name. thus, you don’t need separate variables for each item of data
- an array is a fixed number of data items that are all of the same type — an array is not flexible to several types of data or changing the number of items throughout the code
## declaring an array
- the data items in an array are referred to as elements
- the elements have to be the same type
- declaring an array is similar to declaring a normal variable:
```C
long numbers[10]
```
- the example above has 11 elements: 0-10 — this is the size of the array, or array dimension
## accessing an array’s elements
- each of the data items stored in an array is accessed by the same name
- you select a particular element by using an index/subscript value between ‘[]’ following the array name
- index values are sequential integers that start from zero
- you can also specify an index for an array element by an expression in the ‘[]’ following the array name
- it’s common to use a loop to access each element in an array
```C 
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	printf("number is %d", numbers[i]);
```

## array “out of bounds”
- if one uses an expression or a variable for an index value that is outside the range for the array, the program may crash or the array can contain garbage data — this is referred to as an “out of bounds” error
- the compiler cannot check for out of bounds errors, so the program will still compile
## assigning values to an array
- a value can be stored in an element of an array simply by specifying the array element on the left side of an equal sign
```C
grades[100] = 95;
```
## example
```C
int main (void){
	int grades[10];
	int count = 10;
	long sum = 0;
	float average = 0.0f;

	printf("\nenter the 10 grades:\n");

	for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i){
		printf("%2u> ", i + 1);
		scanf("%d", &grades[i]);
		sum += grades[i];
	}

	average = (float)sum / count;
	
	printf("\naverage of the ten grades entered is: %.2f\n", average);

	return 0;
}
```
## initializing an array
- defining initial values for array elements makes it easier to detect when things go wrong
- to initialize an array’s values, one simply provides the values in a list — values in the list are separated by commas and the entire list is enclosed in a pair of braces
```C
int counters[5] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
int integers[5] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
```
- if fewer initial values are specified, the non-initialized elements’s values in the array are set to 0
### designated initializers
- C99 added a feature called designated initializers, which allow one to pick and choose which elements are initialized
- by enclosing an element number is a pair of brackets, specific array elements can be initialized in any order
```C
float sampleData[500] = { [2] = 500.5, [4] = 300.0, [10] = 100 };
```
- example:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define months 12

int main (void){
	int days[months] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };
	int index;
	
	for (index = 0; index < months; index++)
		printf("month %d has %2d days.\n", index + 1, days[index]);

	return 0;
}
```
- C does not provide any shortcut mechanisms for initializing array elements
- example of initializing all elements to the same value:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void){
	int arr[10] = { 0, 1, 2, 4, 9, 16 };
	int i;
	
	for (i = 5; i < 10; ++i)
		arr[i] = i * i;
	
	for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
		printf("arr[%i] = %i\n", i, arr[i]);

	return 0;
}
```
# multidimensional arrays
- the C language allows arrays of any dimension to be defined
- a two-dimensional array is a nested array: an array of an array
- a two-dimensional array is, in essence, a table or a matrix
```C
int matrix[4][5];
```
- the above example declares the array to consist of 4 rows and 5 columns, for a total of 20 elements
## initializing a two-dimensional array
- two-dimensional arrays can be initialized in the same manner of a one-dimensional array
- when listing elements for initialization, the values are listed by row — the difference is that one puts the initial values for each row between curly braces, and then encloses all the rows between curly braces
```C
int matrix[3][4] = {
	{10, 20, 30, 40},
	{50, 60, 70, 80},
	{90, 100, 110, 120}
};
```
- as with one dimensional arrays, it is not required that the entire array be initialized
```C
int matrix[3][4] = {
	{10, 0},
	{0, 60, 70, 0},
	{90, 0, 120}
};
```
- designated initializers can also be used:
```C
int matrix[4][4] = {[0][0] = 1, [1][1] = 2, [3][3] = 3}
```
## other dimensions
- everything mentioned so fat about arrays can be generalized to three, four, n-dimensional arrays
- nested loops are used for processing all the elements in a multidimensional array
```C
int sum = 0;
int numbers[3][3][3];

for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
	for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j)
		for (int k = 0; k < 3; ++k)
			sum += numbers[i][j][k];
```
# variable-length arrays
- the term “variable” in variable-length array does not mean that you can modify the length of the array dynamically; instead, variable-length arrays allow you to specify the size of an array with a variable when creating an array
- C99 introduced variable-length arrays primarily to allow C to become a better language for numerical computing, and make it easier to convert existing libraries of FORTRAN numerical calculation routines to C
# valid and invalid declarations of an array
```C
int n = 5;
int m = 8;
float a1[5]; // valid
float a2[5 * 2 + 1]; // valid
float a3[sizeof(int) + 1]; // valid
float a4[-4]; // invalid, size must be > 0
float a5[0]; // invalid, size must be > 0
float a6[2.5]; // invalid, size must be an integer
float a7[(int)2.5]; // valid, typecast float to int constant
float a8[n]; // valid after C99
float a9[m]; // valid after c99
```
