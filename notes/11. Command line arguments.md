# Overview
- There are times when a program is developed that required the user to enter a small amount of information at the terminal
- The information might consist of a number indicating the triangular number that you want to have calculated or a word that you want to have looked up in a dictionary
- There are two ways of handling this:
	- Requesting the data from the user, or
	- Supplying the information to the program at the time the program is executed, through command line arguments
- The  `main()` function is a special function, not only because it is the entry point of the program, but also because it can be used to get command line arguments
- When `main()` is called by the runtime system, two arguments are actually passed to the function
	- The first argument, `argc` – which stands for “argument count” –, is an integer value that specifies the number of arguments typed on the command line
	- The second argument, `argv` – which stands for “argument vector” –, is an array of character pointers (strings)
- The first entry in this array is a pointer to the name of the program that is executing
- The other entries can be set by the developer to contain certain information
