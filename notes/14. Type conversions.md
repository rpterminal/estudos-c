- Conversion of data between different types can happen automatically (implicit conversion) by the language, or explicitly by the program
- To effectively develop C programs, one must understand the rules used for the implicit conversion of floating-point and integer values in C
- Normally, you shouldnâ€™t mix types, but there are occasions when it is useful
- Whenever a floating-point value is assigned to an integer variable in C, the decimal portion of the number gets truncated. For example:
```C
int x = 0;
float f = 12.125;
x = f; // value stored in x is the number 12 -- only the int portion is stored
```
- Assigning an integer variable to a floating-point variable does not cause any change in the value of the number
- When performing integer arithmetic:
	- If two operands in an expression are integers, any decimal portion resulting from a division operation is discarded, even if the result is assigned to a floating-point variable
	- If one operand is an integer and the other is a floating-point, the operation is performed as a floating-point operation
