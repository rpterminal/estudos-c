- The binary system is a numerical system that includes ones and zeroes
- The number could be of any length
- The following are all examples of binary numbers:
	- 0
	- 1
	- 10
	- 01
	- 111000
	- 000111
	- 10101
	- 0101010
	- 1011110101
	- 0110101110
- Every binary number has a corresponding decimal value, and vice-versa. Examples:
	- 1 = 1
	- 10 = 2
	- 11 = 3
	- 1010111 = 87
- Each position for a binary number has a value
- In general, the “position values” in a binary number are the powers of two
	- The first position value is 2^0, i.e. one
	- The second position value is 2^1, i.e. two
	- The third position value is 2^2, i.e. four
	- The fourth position value is 2^3, i.e. eight
	- etc.
- To calculate a binary in decimal form, you must:
	- For each digit, multiply the digit by its position value
	- Add up all the products to get the final result
