- a function is a self-contained unit of program code designed to accomplish a particular task
- syntax rules define the structure of a function and how it can be used
- a function in C is the same as subroutines and procedures in other programming languages
- some functions can: cause an action to take place, such as `printf()`; find a value for a program to use, such as `strlen()`;
- when functions are invoked, data is passed to them through arguments based on the parameters of the function
- functions output information back through one of the function arguments or as a return value
### main() function
- `main()` is a specially recognized name in the C system
- it indicates where the program is to begin execution
- all C programs must always have a `main()`
- one can pass data to it (command line arguments)
- returning data is optional (error code)
## advantages
- functions allow for the divide and conquer strategy: it’s difficult to write, test, debug and maintain an entire program as a single large main function
- with divide and conquer, tasks can be divided into several independent subtasks, reducing the overall complexity, which can be further divided into smaller subtasks
- reduces duplication of code and size of the source code, to save time when writing, testing and debugging code
- when having to do a certain task several times throughout a program, one only needs to write an appropriate function once and apply it whenever needed
- the functions developed for one program can be used in another program through libraries
- helps with readability and organization — easier to read, change and fix
- allows parts of the program to be developed, tested and debugged independently, reducing the overall development time
- functions work like a “black box” — there’s information that goes in (the input) and the value or action it produces (the output)
- using this “black box” thinking helps you concentrate on the program’s overall design rather than the details: what the function should do and how it relates to the program as a whole before worrying about writing the code
## examples
- stdio
	- `printf()`: first argument is usually a string literal, and the succeeding arguments, of which there may be none, are a series of variables or expressions whose values are to be displayed
	- `scanf()`
```C
#define SIZE 50

int main(void){
	float list[SIZE];
	
	readlist(list, SIZE);
	sort(list, SIZE);
	average(list, SIZE);
	
	return 0;
}
```
## implementing functions
- one can utilize functions that are implemented by the C language, implemented by a library or user defined
- readability and generality are characteristics to be sought after in a function for ease of use and to allow the use in other programs
## defining functions
- when creating a function, one specifies the function header as the first line of the definition
- the executable code is in between curly braces, and is called the function body
- the function header defines the name of the function, and, between parentheses, defines the parameters — number and types of values that are passed to the function when it’s called — and the type for the value that the function returns
- the function body contains the statements to be executed when the function is called — it will have access to any values that are passed as arguments to the function
- structure:
```C
returntype functionname(parameters, parameters, parameters...){
	statements;
	statements;
	statements; ...
}
```
- the first line of a function definition tells the compiler, from left to right, three things about the function:
	1. the type of value it returns
	2. its name
	3. the arguments it takes
- example:
```C
void printMessage(void){
	printf("message to be displayed");
}
```
- the first line of the printMessage() function tells the compiler that the function returns no value — keyword “void”
- next is its name: printMessage
- after that, the keyword “void” tells the compiler that it takes no arguments
- the statements in the function body can be absent, but the braces must be present
- if there are no statements in the function body, the return type must be void
- defining a function with an empty body is often useful during the testing phase of a complicated program: it allows one to run the program with only selected functions actually doing something
- one can then add the detailing for the function bodies step by step, testing at each stage, until the whole code is implemented and fully tested
## naming functions
- the name of the function can be any legal name
	- not a reserved word, such as int, double, sizeof, etc.
	- not the same name as another function in the same program
	- not the same name as any of the standard library functions — such would prevent one from using the library function
- a legal name has the same restrictions as that of a variable
- choosing meaningful function names is just as important as choosing meaningful variable names
## function prototypes
- a function prototype is a statement that defines a function
- defines its name, its return value type, and the type of each of its parameters
- provides all the external specifications for the function
- one can write a prototype for a function exactly the same as the function header, with the difference that one has to add a semicolon at the end, like a statement: `void printMessage(void);`
- a function prototype enables the compiler to generate the appropriate instructions at each point where you call the function; it also checks that one is using the function correctly in each invocation
- when one includes a standard header file in a program, the header file adds the function prototypes for the library to the program; for example, the header file stdio.h contains function prototypes for printf(), scanf(), among others
- generally appear at the beginning of a source file prior to the implementations of any function, or in a header file
- allows any of the functions in the file to call any function regardless of where you have placed the implementations of said functions
- parameter names do not have to be the same as those used in the function definition, but the data types need to be the same
- it is good practice to always include declarations for all of the functions in a program source file, regardless of where they are called — it helps in the program design consistency and prevents any erros from occurring if, at any stage, the developer chooses to call a function from another part of a program
- example:
```C
// #include & #define directives

// function prototypes
double average(double dataValues[], size_t count);
double sum(double *x, size_t n);
size_t getData(double*, size_t);

int main(void){
	// code in main()
}

// definitions/implementations for average(), sum() and getData()
```
# arguments and parameters
- a parameter is a variable in a function declaration and definition/implementation
- when a function is called, the arguments are the data one passes into the functions’ parameters — it is the actual value of a variable that gets passed to the function
- function parameters are defined within the function headers, and are placeholders for the arguments that need to be specified when the function is called
- the parameters for a function are a list of parameter names with their types, each separated by a comma. the entire list of parameters is enclosed between the parentheses that follow the function name
- a function can have no parameters, in which case `void` is used as the parameter
- parameters provide the means to pass data to a function — data is passed from the calling function to the function that is called
- the names of the parameters are local to the function and will assume the values of the arguments that are passed when the function is called
- the body of the function should use these parameters in its implementation
- a function body may have additional locally defined variables that are needed by the function’s implementation
- when passing an array as an argument to a function, one must also pass an additional argument specifying the size of the array
- for example: when the `printf()` function is called, one always supplies one or more values as arguments
- parameters greatly increase the usefulness and flexibility of a function
- it is a good idea to add comments before each of one’s function definitions, explaining what the function does and how the arguments are to be used
- example:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

void multiplyTwoNumbers(int x, int y){
	int result = x * y;
	printf("the product of % multiplied by %d is: %d\n", x, y, result);
}

int main (void){
	multiplyTwoNumbers(10, 20);
	multiplyTwoNumbers(20, 30);
	multiplyTwoNumbers(50, 2);
	
	return 0;
}
```
