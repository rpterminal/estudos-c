- Four fundamental tasks:
	- Editing
	- Compiling
	- Linking
	- Executing
- These processes are essentially the same for developing programs in any environment and with any compiled language
# Editing
- The process of creating and modifying your C source code
- The source code is inside a file that contains the program instructions you write
- All source files end in the .c extension
- A text editor or IDE is used to create source code
# Compiling
- A compiler converts your source code into machine language and detects and reports errors in your code
- The input to the compiler is the file you produce during your editing, the source file
- Compilation is a two-stage process: first, the preprocessing phase, during which your code may be modified or added to; second, the actual compilation that generates the object code
- The compiler examines each program statement and checks it to ensure it conforms to the syntax and semantics of the language
- It can also recognize structural errors
- It doesn't find logic errors
- Typical errors reported might be due to an expression that has unbalanced parentheses (syntactic error), or due to the use of a variable that is not "defined" (semantic error)
- After all errors are fixed, the compiler will then take each statement of the program and translate it to assembly language
- The compiler will then translate the assembly language statements into actual machine instructions
- The output from the compiler is known as object code and it is stored in files called object files, a source file with a .obj or .o extension
- The standard command to compile C programs will be cc, or, in the GNU compiler, gcc
	- `cc -c file.c` or `gcc -c file.c`
	- If you omit the `-c` flag, the program will be automatically linked
	- In an IDE, this process is automatic
# Linking
- After the program has been translated into object code, it is ready to be linked
- The purpose of the linking phase is to get the program into a final form for execution
- Linking usually occurs automatically when compiling depending on what system you are on, but, sometimes, it can be a separate command
- Linking gets all the dependencies in place to build the executable file
- The linker combines the object modules generated by the compiler with additional libraries needed by the program to create the whole executable. If part of your program is missing, or a nonexistent library component is referenced, it detects and reports the errors.
- Program libraries support and extend the C language by providing routines to carry out operations that are not part of the language. For example: input and output libraries, mathematical libraries, string manipulation libraries, etc.
- A failure during the linking phase means that once again you have to go back and edit your source code.
- If the compiling and linking are successful, an executable file will be produced
	- In a Windows environment, the executable file will have an .exe extension
	- In UNIX/Linux, there will be no such extension. The executable will be defined as a.out by default
- Many IDEs have a build option, which will compile and link your program in a single operation to produce the executable
- A program of any significant size will consist of several source code files. Each source code file needs the compiler to generate the object file that needs to be linked
- The program is much easier to manage by breaking it up into a number of smaller source files, each with a specific functionality. It makes the development of maintenance of the program more cohesive and, thus, a lot easier to manage
- The set of source files that make up the program will usually be integrated under a project name, which is used to refer to the whole program
# Executing
- In most IDEs, this process is access through an appropriate menu command that allows you to run or execute a compiled program
- The execution stage is where you run your program
- Each of the statements of the program is executed, in turn, sequentially
- If the program requires any input, the program temporarily suspends its execution so that the input can be entered
- The output of the program appears in a window called the console
- This stage can also generate a wide variety of error conditions, such as: producing the wrong output, looping infinitely, crashing the computer, etc.
- If the program does not perform the intended functionality, it will be necessary to go back and reanalyze the program's logic. This is known as the debugging phase: to correct all the known problems or bugs from the program. In this phase, changes will be made to the original source program.
# Stages in C
- The entire process of editing, compiling, linking and executing the program must be repeated until the desired results are obtained and the program meets all of the design's requirements
