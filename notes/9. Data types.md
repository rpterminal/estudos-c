# What are data types?
- Some types of data in programs are numbers, letters, or words.
- A computer needs a way to identify and use these different kinds of data
- A data type represents a type of the data which you can process using the program
	- Examples in C include ints, floats, doubles, etc.
	- They also correspond to byte sizes on the platform of your program
- Primitive data types are types that are not objects and store all sorts of data. There are no types other than primitive in C
# Basic data types
- Some examples of basic data types in C are:
	- `int`
	- `float`
	- `double`
	- `char`
	- `bool` 
- The difference between the types is in the amount of memory they occupy and the range of values they can hold
- The amount of storage that is allocated to store a particular type of data depends on the computer you are running. An integer might take up 32 bits on your computer, or perhaps it might be stored in 64 bits
## Numeric types
- The `int` type meets most of your integer needs when beginning with C. However, C offers many other integer types
	- They give the programmer the option of matching a type to a particular use case
	- Integer types vary in the range of values offered and in whether negative numbers can be used
- C offers three adjective keywords to modify the basic integer type: short, long, and unsigned
	- The type `short int`, or `short`, may use less storage than int, thus saving space when only small numbers are needed. It can be used when the program needs a lot of memory and the amount of available memory is limited
	- The type `long int`, or `long`, may use more storage than `int`, thus enabling you to express larger integer values
	- The type `long long int`, or `long long`, may use more storage than `long`. A constant value of type `long` is formed by optionally appending the letter L (upper- or lowercase) onto the end of an integer constant. For example: `long int intVar = 131071100L;`
	- The type `unsigned int`, or `unsigned`, is used for variables that have only non-negative values. It allows the accuracy of the integer variable to be extended
	- The keyword `signed` can be used with any of the signed types to make your intent explicit
	- `short`, `short int`, `signed short`, and `signed short int` are all names for the same type
### The `int` type
- A variable of type `int` can be used to contain integral values, i.e., values that do not contain decimal places, whole numbers
- A minus sign preceding the data type and variable indicates that the value is negative
- The `int` type is a signed integer: it must be an integer and it can be positive, negative, or zero
- If an integer is preceded by a zero and the letter “x”, the value is taken as being expressed in hexadecimal (base 16) notation
	- Example: `int rgbColor = 0xFFEf0D;`
- The values 158, -10, and 0 are all valid examples of integer constants
- No embedded spaces are permitted between the digits
- Values larger than 999 cannot be expressed using commas. For example, 12,000 must be written as 12000
### The `float` type
- A variable of type `float` can be used for storing floating-point numbers, i.e., values containing decimal places
- The values 3., 125.9 and -.0001 are all valid examples of floating-point constants that can be assigned to a variable
- Floating-point constants can also be expressed in scientific notation
	- 1.7e4 is a floating-point value expressed in this notation and represents the value 1.7 * 10^4 
### The `double` type
- A variable of type `double` is the same as type float, only with roughly twice the precision
- It is used whenever the range provided by a float variable is not sufficient
- It can store twice as many significant digits
- Most computers represent double values using 64 bits
- All floating-point constants are taken as `double` values by the C compiler
- To explicitly express a `float` constant, append an f (either upper- or lowercase) to the end of the number. For example: `12.5f`
- Type specifiers can also be applied to doubles. For example: `long double doubleVar;` or `double doubleVar = 1.234e+7L;`
### The `_Bool` type
- The `_Bool` data type can be used to store just the values 0 or 1
- Used for indicating an on/off, yes/no, or true/false situation, i.e., binary choices
- `_Bool` variables are used in programs that need to indicate a Boolean condition
- A variable of this type might be used to indicate whether all data has been read from a file
- 0 indicates a false value; 1 indicates a true value
### The `enum` data type
- A data type that allows a programmer to define a variable and specify the valid values that could be stored in that variable
- For example, you can create a variable named “primaryColor” and it can only contain one of the primary colors: red, yellow, or blue, and no other values
- Variables that are declared to be of this data type can only be assigned inside the program with the values specified, and no other values
- You first have to define the `enum` type and give it a name
	- Initiated by the keyword `enum` -> name of the enumerated data type -> list of identifiers, enclosed in a set of curly braces, that define the permissible values that can be assigned to the type
- To declare a variable to be of type `enum`:
	- Use the keyword `enum` -> enumerated type name -> variable list
- Example:
```C
enum primaryColor {red, yellow, blue};
enum primaryColor myColor, otherColor;
myColor = red;
```
- This defines the two variables `myColor` and `otherColor` to be of type `primaryColor`, thus, the only permissible values that can be assigned to these variables are the names red,  yellow, and blue
#### `enum`s as `int`s
- The compiler actually treats enumeration identifiers as integer constants. As such, the first name in the list is “0”. Example:
```C
enum month {January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December}
enum month thisMonth;
thisMonth = February
```
- The value “1” is assigned to `thisMonth`, and not “February”, because it is the second identifier listed inside the enumeration list
- If you want to have a specific integer value associated with an enumeration identifier, the integer can be assigned to the identifier when the data type is defined. Example:
	`enum direction {up, down, left = 10, right}`
	- An enumerated data type `direction` is defined with the values “up”, “down”, “left”, and “right”. As such, “up” = “0”, as it appears first in the list, “down” = “1” because it appears next, “left” = 10 because it is explicitly assigned this value, and “right” = “11” because it appears immediately after “left” in the list
## The `char` data type
- `char` represents a single character such as the letter ‘a’, the digit character ‘6’, or a semicolon (‘;’)
- Character literals use single quotes such as ‘A’ or ‘Z’
- You can also declare `char` variables to be unsigned, and they can be used to explicitly tell the compiler that a particular variable is a signed quantity
- Character string =/= `char` (character) data type
- Declaring a `char`:
```C
char myChar; /* declaring the variable */
myChar = 'T'; /* correct syntax */
myChar = T; /* incorrect syntax */
myChar = "T" /* incorrect syntax */
```
- If you omit the quotes, the compiler thinks that T is the name of a variable
- If you use double quotes, the compiler thinks that “T” is a string
- You can also use the numerical code to assign values. Example: `char myChar = 65`;
# Escape characters
- C contains special characters that represent actions, such as:
	- Backspacing;
	- Going to the next line;
	- Making the terminal bell ring, or speaker beep
- We can represent these actions by using special symbol sequences called escape sequences
- Escape sequences must be enclosed in single quotes when assigned to a character variable
- A lot of the escape characters start with a backslash
- Example: `char x = '\n'` 
	- If you were to print the variable `x`, the program would advance to the next line
- Some escape sequences are:
